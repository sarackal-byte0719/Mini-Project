Kaggle Heart Disease Project

data file taken from site : https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Columns descriptions:

age : in years

sex :(1 = male; 0 = female)

cp: chest pain type (0-4)

trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol : serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg : resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)

thalach : maximum heart rate achieved

exang : exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca :number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

tha : l3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

target : presence of heart disease (1 = presence of heart disease or 0 = presence of heart disease)
